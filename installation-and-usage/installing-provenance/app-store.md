## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "This app is not available in your region"

Provenance may not be available in all App Store regions due to Apple's policies. **Alternatives:**
- Use a different Apple ID with a supported region
- [Sideload](sideloading.md) using AltStore (no region restrictions)
- [Build from source](building-from-source.md) (developers)

### "Cannot download - not enough storage"

Provenance is ~2.5 GB and needs additional space for games:
- Free up space by deleting unused apps/files
- Move photos/videos to iCloud or computer
- Recommended: 10+ GB free for comfortable use

### Installation stuck or won't complete

1. Force-close App Store app
2. Restart your device
3. Try downloading again
4. If still stuck, check Apple's [System Status](https://www.apple.com/support/systemstatus/) for App Store issues

### App crashes on launch

1. Ensure your device is on iOS 16.0+ (Settings → General → About)
2. Restart your device
3. Delete and reinstall Provenance
4. If still crashing, [report the issue](https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance/issues)
