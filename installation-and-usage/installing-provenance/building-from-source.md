# Building from Source

To get the very latest in-development build, you will need to build from source with Xcode. There are no shortcuts. Provenance is a large project with required dependencies and submodules that help enable efficient development. Check that you meet the requirements. Follow each and every step. Make no assumptions. **Do not** skip _anything._

1. [**Get Source**](building-from-source.md#get-source)
2. [**Setup**](building-from-source.md#setup) \(install requirements and dependencies\)
3. [**Build Source**](building-from-source.md#build-source) to device \(Xcode\)
4. _\(Optional\)_ [**Enable Advanced Features**](building-from-source.md#advanced-features)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The beta is in active-development.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
DO NOT expect to use a beta without issues, losing your saves, or bugs.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Requirements**

* macOS 12
  * on a Mac, Hackintosh or virtual machine \([Virtualizing macOS](https://wiki.provenance-emu.com/info/miscellaneous/virtualizing-macos)\)
* [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) 13.3+
* iOS 11+ a/o tvOS 10+ SDKs
* _Free_ [Apple Developer](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/) account \(at a minimum\) or a _paid_ account.

üõë **DO NOT** enroll to join the full Developer Program or you will be locked into a _Pending_ payment state, unable to code-sign unless you pay or contact Apple to cancel the enrollment.

* Connections:

## Get Source

**Source Options**

* üîÉ  [**Clone**](building-from-source.md#clone) using‚Ä¶
  * ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3118097/37563629-48ec3f26-2a42-11e8-9fd8-784e9e830ebe.png) [Terminal](building-from-source.md#terminal)
  * ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3118097/37563630-4903ebbc-2a42-11e8-888a-09a94fc0058d.png) [Tower](building-from-source.md#tower)

### Clone

Cloning is how you pull the source code from GitHub. The primary way to do this is using Terminal; However, if you're a developer or familiar with powerful git clients like Tower, this is also an option as long as you enable for initializing submodules.

#### **Terminal**

{% hint style="info" %}
The Terminal app can be found in: _/Applications/Utilities_
{% endhint %}

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command-line tools installed: `xcode-select --install`
2. _\(Optional\)_ Choose an install directory with `cd [path]` \(drag & drop a folder on Terminal after `cd`  to get directory path\).
3. Download source with‚Ä¶
   * HTTPS: `git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance.git`
4. Continue to [Setup](building-from-source.md#setup)‚Ä¶

#### **Tower**

Tower is a powerful commercial git client that can automate a lot of the tasks you'd otherwise be using commandline for, such as stashing changes. It is however, _not free._

1. Purchase/Download [Tower](https://www.git-tower.com/mac/)
2. Launch Tower and Add Your Service Account: `GitHub`
3. _\(Optional\)_ In Menubar: Select `Tower` ‚Üí `Preferences` \(or use `‚åò,` shortcut\):
   * Set a 'default directory for clone repositories' such as `~Documents/GitHub`
4. In Menubar: Select `File` ‚Üí `Clone Git Repository` \(or use `‚åÉ‚åòC` shortcut\):
   * Remote URL: `https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance.git`
   * ‚òëÔ∏è Initialize Submodules
5. Continue to [Setup](building-from-source.md#setup)‚Ä¶

~~**Download**~~

üö´ Due to the inclusion of submodules this method no longer works. **Do not** manually download source as `.zip`‚Ä¶

{% hint style="danger" %}
If building from active develop branch, we _will not_ be held responsible for any loss of your game data! Install _**at your own risk!**_ ‚Ä¶and back up your files.
{% endhint %}

## Build Source

1. Open the Provenance Xcode workspace: ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3118097/37574056-3e07abe2-2adb-11e8-948c-acb4d539e658.png) `Provenance.xcworkspace`

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Do not** use the .xcodeproj file or you will have build errors!

   ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3118097/37563995-73fdd65e-2a4a-11e8-949f-5aa8351dcbb2.png)

2. Go to Preferences via Menubar: `Xcode` ‚Üí `Preferences` or use `‚åò,` shortcut.
   * Select Accounts tab.
   * Click `+`
   * Sign in with your personal or developer Apple ID. If you don't have one, click `Create Apple ID` or go to [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
At minimum, sign up as a free [Apple Developer](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/27/how-to-create-free-apple-developer-account-sideload-apps/) and do no more than agree to the terms.

üõë DO NOT enroll to join the full Developer Program or you will be locked into a _Pending_ payment state, unable to code-sign unless you pay or contact Apple to cancel the enrollment.
{% endhint %}

Copy `CodeSigning.xcconfig.sample` to `CodeSigning.xcconfig` and modify the file replacing `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` with your Team ID and `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_PREFIX` with a bundle identifier that is registered to you.

If you have a paid Apple Developer account, you can find your Team ID at https://developer.apple.com/account/#/membership

If you have a free Apple Developer account, you need to generate a new signing certificate. To do so, follow the steps in [iOS App Signer][3] to create a new Xcode project and generate a provisioning profile. After saving the project, open `project.pbxproj` inside your newly created `.xcproj` and look for `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`. Copy this value to `CodeSigning.xcconfig` and your unique identifier to `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_PREFIX`.

Set `DEVELOPER_ACCOUNT_PAID = YES` if you used a paid Apple Developer account in order to automatically request the increased memory limit entitlement from Apple.

{% hint style="info" %}
 You can install a duplicate app for testing by using a different bundle ID than your previous/main install.
{% endhint %}

* If using a free Apple Developer account, **Turn OFF** these Capabilities for _all_ targets:
  * ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3118097/48986708-22f14800-f0cd-11e8-98ec-6f093375d969.png)  App Groups

{% hint style="info" %}
Free Apple developer provisioning expires _every 7 days_, requiring reloading, but you will not lose any data.

_Paid_ Apple Developer provisioning may only require re-signing once a year.

## üí¢ Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble building or sideloading the app, check for your issue here or below in Known Issues.

### xcrun: error: unable to find utility "xcodebuild", not a developer tool or in PATH

* Go to Xcode Preferences&gt;Locations, and make sure to select an Xcode version for Command Line Tools.

### Unable to code-sign / install‚Ä¶

* Change the Bundle IDs of the app targets and extensions, as described in Build Source steps.
* If you are using a free Apple developer account, you can only install a total of 3 apps per Apple ID at a time. You must use delete some apps you are signing, or install with different Apple ID and Bundle IDs.
* If you used to have a free Safari Developer Account which is no longer supported by Apple, you have two options:

  1\) Upgrade to a _paid_ [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account.

  2\) Use a different Apple ID that _is not_ an expired and deprecated Safari Developer account.

### Can't install after changing fork / pulling‚Ä¶

1. Check the Bundle IDs haven't been reset to the projects defaults.
2. If not, select your team drop down and reselect your team / name. Sometimes Xcode gets out of sync with the identity being used after a merge / pull / branch change, especially in the extension targets.

### **Cycle in dependencies between targets‚Ä¶ error**

* Circular dependency error. Clean Build Folder \(‚áß‚åòK\) and/or nuke Xcode's derived data: `rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData` and restart Xcode.

### Stuttering sound or lag

* This probably means you built the _debug version_ by mistake \(app will be named `Prov Debug` on Home Screen and the version displayed in Settings will be `DEBUG`\)‚Ä¶ If so, Re-build using `Provenance-Release` \(iOS\) or `ProvenanceTV-Release` \(tvOS\) option in Xcode.

### **‚Äîapplication-identifier entitlement does not match‚Ä¶**

* This means you need to match the Bundle IDs with the ones from your previous sideload or build on your device. If you don't know it, or used a 3rd party web-sign \(unsupported\), we recommend you[ backup your files](../../info/miscellaneous/restoring-files.md), delete the app and try to clean-install.

### **Your maximum App ID limit has been reached‚Ä¶**

* You have made too many Bundle IDs \(App IDs\) in one week on a free Apple developer account. Stop making new Bundle IDs and revert to one you already made. You are chasing the wrong problem. If all else fails, use a different Apple ID, and make only one new, unique Bundle ID with it \(and save it for later when you need to re-sign in 7 days\).

### **something something ‚Ä¶Mupen build error**

* You are missing submodules. **Do not** download .zip from GitHub. Use Terminal. Go back to [Get Source](building-from-source.md#get-source) and **do not** skip any steps. 

### Unsupported arch

* You are probably trying to build for a 32-bit device. Provenance only support 64bit devices at this time.  as only mupen64plus requires 64-bit at this time, try this as a **workaround**: Remove the mupen64plus framework from the apps `Embed` and `Link` stages and from the `Build ‚Üí Targets` list in the `Edit Scheme‚Ä¶` settings.

### Duplicate app

* If app installs or updates as a duplicate app instead of updating existing installation, you need delete it and  use the _same_ Bundle ID as your original build or you'll end up with a double installation‚Ä¶

### **Linking‚Ä¶ Failed**

* Fails when switching from one target to another. Try‚Ä¶
  1. In Xcode: Run `Clean` a/o `Clean Build Folder` and rebuild.

### **git@github.com: Permission denied \(publickey\)‚Ä¶**

* Setup an [SSH Key on your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/), or‚Ä¶
* Add the following to your bash file via `nano ~/.gitconfig` \(save with Write Out `^O`\):

  ```bash
   [url "https://github.com"]
   insteadOf = ssh://git@github.com
  ```

### **conflicting provisioning settings‚Ä¶Distribution**

* In Build Settings for the targets with errors, manually reset all the Code Signing Identities that are `iOS Distribution` to be `iOS Developer`, and try building again.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues

**something about database build error**

* This means there have been changes to the database model which is no longer compatible with your previous build. In order to update you _**must**_ clean install \(delete app and re-install, not build or install over over existing app\). If you would like to migrate your save games and states, you can refer to [Restoring Files](https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance/wiki/Restoring-Files).

üèç You can install a duplicate app for testing by using a different bundle ID than your previous/main install.
