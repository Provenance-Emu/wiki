# Performance Optimization Guide

Provenance is highly optimized for Apple devices, but performance can vary based on your device, the emulated system, and your settings. This guide helps you get smooth, full-speed emulation across all 38+ supported systems.

## Quick Performance Checklist

✅ **5-Minute Performance Boost:**

1. **Close background apps** - Double-tap Home, swipe up to close
2. **Disable visual effects** - Settings → Turn off Smoothing and CRT filters
3. **Use recommended cores** - See [per-system recommendations](#by-system) below
4. **Enable Low Power Mode** - For longer gaming sessions (slight performance trade-off)
5. **Update to latest version** - Performance improvements in every release

**Still slow?** Continue reading for system-specific optimizations.

#### Nintendo DS

**Performance:** ⚠️ Requires iPhone 8 or newer for full speed

**Tips:**
- **3D games** (Mario 64 DS, Mario Kart DS) need iPhone 11+ for smooth play
- **2D games** (Pokémon, Advance Wars) run well on iPhone 8/8 Plus/X/XS/XR
- **Screen layout:** Vertical layout recommended (one screen above the other)

**Optimization:**
- Lower internal resolution in settings (3x → 2x)
- Disable "High-Res 3D" for 3D games

#### PSP

**Performance:** 🔴 Requires iPhone 11 or newer

**Tips:**
- **Most demanding system** in Provenance
- Works best on iPhone 12 Pro or newer with active cooling
- Apple TV 4K recommended for best experience

**Optimization:**
- Set frameskip to "Auto" or "1" if needed
- Lower internal resolution to 2x (still looks great)
- Disable texture filtering if slow
- Close all background apps

## Advanced Optimization

### Battery Life vs Performance

**Best Battery Life:**
1. ✅ Enable **Low Power Mode** (Settings → Battery)
2. ✅ Lower screen brightness (biggest battery drain)
3. ✅ Play 8-bit/16-bit systems (NES, SNES, GB, Genesis)
4. ✅ Use wired headphones (Bluetooth drains faster)
5. ✅ Disable background app refresh for Provenance

**Battery Impact by System:**
- 🟢 **Low drain:** NES, GB, GBC, SNES, Genesis (~4-6 hours)
- 🟡 **Moderate:** GBA, PlayStation (~3-4 hours)
- 🔴 **High drain:** N64, Dreamcast, PSP (~2-3 hours)

### Visual Quality vs Performance

**Maximum Quality (iPhone 11+ recommended):**
- ✅ Smoothing filter ON
- ✅ CRT filter ON
- ✅ Enhanced resolution (PlayStation, N64)
- ✅ Shader effects (specific cores)

**Balanced (iPhone 8/8 Plus/X/XS/XR):**
- ⚙️ Smoothing: OFF
- ⚙️ CRT filter: OFF
- ⚙️ Enhanced resolution: ON (PlayStation only)

**Maximum Performance (entry-level supported devices):**
- ❌ All filters OFF
- ❌ Native resolution only
- ❌ Frameskip: Auto

### Recommended Cores by System

When multiple cores are available, these are the best performance/compatibility balance:

| System | Recommended Core | Alternative | Notes |
|--------|------------------|-------------|-------|
| **Genesis** | Genesis Plus GX | PicoDrive | Plus GX = better accuracy |
| **SNES** | Snes9x | bsnes | Snes9x = faster |
| **GBA** | mGBA | VBA-M | mGBA = best accuracy |
| **N64** | Mupen64Plus | ParaLLEl | ParaLLEl needs iPhone 11+ |
| **PlayStation** | PCSX-ReARMed | Beetle PSX | ReARMed = faster |

## Troubleshooting Performance Issues

### Game is Slow or Stuttering

**Symptoms:** Framerate drops, audio crackling, sluggish controls

**Solutions (try in order):**

1. ✅ **Close background apps**
   - Double-tap Home button
   - Swipe up on all apps except Provenance

2. ✅ **Disable visual filters**
   - Provenance Settings → Smoothing: OFF
   - Provenance Settings → CRT Filter: OFF

3. ✅ **Check core selection**
   - In-game menu → Core Info
   - Try alternative core if available

4. ✅ **Lower internal resolution**
   - Settings → Video → Resolution Multiplier: 1x or 2x

5. ✅ **Enable frameskip**
   - Settings → Frameskip: Auto

6. ✅ **Restart device**
   - Power off → Wait 10 seconds → Power on

### Specific Game is Slow, Others Are Fine

**Cause:** Game-specific compatibility or CPU-intensive content

**Solutions:**
1. Check online compatibility lists for that core
2. Try alternative ROM dump (bad ROM = poor performance)
3. Some games are just demanding (GoldenEye 007, Conker, etc.)
4. Update to latest Provenance version (cores improve over time)

### Audio Crackling or Popping

**Cause:** CPU can't keep up with audio buffer

**Solutions:**
1. Enable frameskip (lets audio stay smooth)
2. Close background audio apps (Music, Spotify)
3. Disable Bluetooth audio (use wired headphones)
4. Lower in-game audio settings if available

### Performance Got Worse After Update

**Cause:** New settings default, cache issue, or regression

**Solutions:**
1. Check if new visual settings were enabled automatically
2. Delete and reinstall Provenance (backup saves first!)
3. Report regression on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Provenance-Emu/Provenance/issues)
