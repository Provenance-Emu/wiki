# Skins Guide

**Skins** are custom controller overlays that let you personalize the look and feel of Provenance's on-screen controls. Choose from hundreds of community-created designs, from classic console aesthetics to modern minimalist layouts.

## What Are Skins?

Skins change the visual appearance of your on-screen controller buttons and d-pad while you play. Each skin is designed for a specific system (e.g., NES, Game Boy, PlayStation) and can completely transform your gaming experience.

**Examples of popular skin styles:**
- 🎨 **Console-accurate** - Recreates the original hardware's button layout and colors
- 🌈 **Custom colors** - Transparent, neon, retro themes
- 📱 **Minimalist** - Simple, clean buttons that don't obstruct gameplay
- 🎮 **Game-themed** - Styled after specific games (Pokémon, Mario, Sonic)
- 👻 **Invisible** - For Backbone/Kishi users who want physical controls only

## ✨ Key Features

**Skins are 100% FREE for all users!** No Provenance Plus subscription required.

**Highlights:**
- ⚡ Fast rendering and loading

## Creating Custom Skins

### Can I Make My Own Skins?

**Yes!** Custom skin creation is supported, but it requires design tools and familiarity with the `.deltaskin` file format.

**What you need:**
- 🎨 **Image editor** (Photoshop, GIMP, Affinity Designer)
- 📐 **Understanding of JSON** (skin configuration file)
- 📱 **iOS device resolution knowledge** (different layouts for iPhone/iPad)

### File Structure

A `.deltaskin` file is actually a **ZIP archive** containing:

```
MySkin.deltaskin/
├── info.json          # Skin metadata (name, author, system)
├── portrait.png       # Portrait mode controller image
├── landscape.png      # Landscape mode controller image
├── edgeToEdge.png     # (Optional) Full-screen layout
└── assets/            # (Optional) Additional graphics
    └── preview.png    # Thumbnail for skin browser
```

### `info.json` Structure

```json
{
  "name": "My Custom Skin",
  "identifier": "com.yourname.myskin",
  "gameTypeIdentifier": "com.provenance.gba",
  "author": "Your Name",
  "version": "1.0",
  "orientation": "portrait",
  "mappings": {
    "a": { "x": 280, "y": 380, "width": 60, "height": 60 },
    "b": { "x": 340, "y": 320, "width": 60, "height": 60 },
    "dpad": { "x": 40, "y": 360, "width": 100, "height": 100 }
  }
}
```

**Key fields:**
- `gameTypeIdentifier` - System this skin is for (see [System Identifiers](#system-identifiers) below)
- `mappings` - Button positions (x, y coordinates + dimensions)
- `orientation` - "portrait", "landscape", or both

### System Identifiers

| System | Identifier |
|--------|------------|
| NES | `com.provenance.nes` |

## Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Performance

1. ✅ **Use optimized PNGs** - Compress images to reduce file size (tinypng.com)
2. ✅ **Avoid overly complex designs** - Simple graphics load faster
3. ✅ **Test on your device** - Preview how skins look at actual screen size
4. ✅ **Delete unused skins** - Keep your collection organized

### For Better Gameplay

1. 🎮 **Match button placement to your grip** - Different layouts feel better for different hand sizes
2. 🔆 **Consider transparency** - Semi-transparent buttons let you see more of the game
3. 📱 **Test both orientations** - Some games play better in portrait vs landscape
4. 👀 **Check button visibility** - Make sure buttons are easy to see against game graphics

### Popular Community Recommendations

**Best all-around skins (per DeltaStyles ratings):**
- **GBA:** "Atomic Purple" (classic transparent purple)
- **SNES:** "Classic Gray" (original SNES controller recreation)
- **PlayStation:** "DualShock" (authentic PS1 button layout)
- **Game Boy:** "DMG Original" (1989 gray brick aesthetic)

## Troubleshooting

### Skin Not Showing in Browser

**Problem:** Imported skin doesn't appear in the skin list

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Check file extension** - Must be `.deltaskin` (not `.zip`)
2. ✅ **Verify system** - Skin must match a supported system (DS not yet supported; 3DS not supported on tvOS)
3. ✅ **Restart Provenance** - Force quit app and reopen
4. ✅ **Re-import** - Delete and re-download the skin

### Skin Looks Corrupted or Glitchy

**Problem:** Buttons are misaligned, missing, or stretched

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Re-download skin** - File may have been corrupted during download
2. ✅ **Check device compatibility** - Some skins are iPhone-only or iPad-only
3. ✅ **Update Provenance** - Ensure you're on the latest version from the App Store
4. ✅ **Report to skin creator** - Leave feedback on DeltaStyles or GitHub

### Buttons Don't Respond

**Problem:** Tapping skin buttons doesn't register input

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Check `info.json` mappings** - Button coordinates may be wrong
2. ✅ **Disable "Touch Controls"** - Settings → ensure touch controls are enabled
3. ✅ **Try a different skin** - Test if the issue is skin-specific
4. ✅ **Restart game** - Close and relaunch the game

### Performance Slowdown with Skins

**Problem:** Game lags or stutters after applying a skin

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Use simpler skins** - Complex, high-resolution graphics add overhead
2. ✅ **Update to the latest version** - Contains skin performance improvements
3. ✅ **Close background apps** - Free up memory
4. ✅ **Disable visual filters** - Turn off CRT/Smoothing in settings

## Storage & File Management

### Where Are Skins Stored?

Skins are stored on your device in Provenance's app container.

**iCloud sync:** On Apple TV (tvOS), iCloud/CloudKit sync is included for free.

**File size:** Most skins are 500KB - 2MB each (negligible storage impact).

### How to Organize Many Skins

**Recommended workflow:**
1. **Delete unused skins** - Swipe left in skin browser
2. **Name skins clearly** - Use descriptive names when creating custom skins
3. **Keep backups** - Save favorite skins to iCloud Drive or Files app

### Sharing Skins

**How to share your custom skins:**
1. Export the `.deltaskin` file from Provenance
2. Upload to DeltaStyles.com (create free account)
3. Or share via AirDrop, Discord, Reddit

**Community etiquette:**
- 🙏 Credit original artists if you modify their work
- 📝 Include a preview screenshot when sharing
- 🔄 Share source files (PSD/Figma) for easier community remixing
