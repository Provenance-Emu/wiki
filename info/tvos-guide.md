## Performance Tips

### Optimize for Big-Screen Gaming

**Reduce Input Latency:**
1. 🌐 **Use Ethernet instead of WiFi** - Dramatically improves Bluetooth controller performance
2. 📺 **Enable "Game Mode" on your TV** - Reduces display lag (check TV settings)
3. 🎨 **Turn off Dolby Vision** - Adds processing delay (Settings → Video and Audio)
4. 🔌 **Disconnect unused Bluetooth devices** - Reduces interference
5. 📡 **Position Apple TV in open space** - Avoid thick walls, metal objects near device

**Graphics & Performance:**
- ⚙️ **Disable "Smoothing" and "CRT filters"** - Slight performance gain (Provenance Settings)
- 🎞️ **Use native resolution** - Don't force 4K upscaling on non-4K TVs

**System-Specific:**
- **N64 on older Apple TV HD:** Some games may need frameskip enabled
- **PlayStation:** Runs full speed on all Apple TV models
- **Dreamcast:** Requires Apple TV 4K for best performance

### Expected Performance

| Apple TV Model | Recommended Systems | Performance Notes |
|---------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Apple TV 4K (2nd/3rd gen)** | All systems up to PlayStation/N64/Dreamcast | Full speed, no compromises |
| **Apple TV 4K (1st gen)** | All systems up to PlayStation/N64 | Dreamcast playable, some slowdown |
| **Apple TV HD (4th gen)** | All systems up to PlayStation | N64 mostly full speed with minor slowdown |

## Troubleshooting

### Controller Not Pairing

**Problem:** Controller won't connect or keeps disconnecting

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Forget and re-pair:**
   - Settings → Remotes and Devices → Bluetooth → Select controller → Forget Device
   - Re-pair from scratch
2. ✅ **Check battery:** Low battery causes connection issues
3. ✅ **Reduce interference:** Move WiFi routers, microwave ovens away from Apple TV

5. ✅ **Use Ethernet:** Wired connection improves Bluetooth stability

### Games Running Slow or Stuttering

**Problem:** Lag, framerate drops, audio stuttering

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Check build type:** App should say "Provenance" not "Prov Debug" (debug builds are slow)
2. ✅ **Disable visual effects:** Turn off Smoothing, CRT filters in settings
3. ✅ **Enable Game Mode on TV:** Check your TV's picture settings
4. ✅ **Close other apps:** Double-tap TV button, swipe up to close unused apps

### iCloud Sync Not Working

**Problem:** Games or saves not syncing between devices

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Verify Provenance Plus:** Active subscription required for sync
2. ✅ **Check iCloud storage:** Settings → Accounts → iCloud → Manage Storage (need available space)
3. ✅ **Enable iCloud in Provenance:** App Settings → iCloud Sync → ON (on all devices)
4. ✅ **Check network:** iCloud sync requires active internet connection
5. ✅ **Force sync:** Close and reopen Provenance to trigger manual sync

### ROM Not Showing in Library

**Problem:** Imported ROM doesn't appear

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ **Check file format:** See [supported formats](../installation-and-usage/roms/formatting-roms.md)

4. ✅ **Re-import:** Delete and re-add the ROM
5. ✅ **Restart app:** Force quit Provenance and relaunch

### Black Screen After Launching Game

2. ✅ **Try different ROM:** File may be corrupted
