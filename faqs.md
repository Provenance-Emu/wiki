5. ✅ **Check device compatibility** - GameCube/Wii need iPhone 11+ or M1 iPad

**Detailed guide:** [Performance Optimization](info/performance-optimization.md)

### Controller not working / buttons not responding

**Solutions:**

1. ✅ **Re-pair controller**

4. ✅ **Reduce interference**
   - Move WiFi routers away from device
   - Use Ethernet on Apple TV (improves Bluetooth stability)

**Full guide:** [Controllers & Controls](info/controllers-and-controls/)

### ROMs won't import / games missing from library

**Checklist:**

## Migration & Switching

### Can I migrate from Delta or RetroArch?

**Yes!** Your ROMs and saves are compatible.

**From Delta:**
1. Export saves from Delta (if needed)
2. Import ROMs into Provenance (same files work)
3. BIOS files: Copy to Provenance if needed
4. ✅ Delta skins work in Provenance (same `.deltaskin` format)

**From RetroArch:**
1. Export save files (.srm, .state)
2. Import ROMs into Provenance
3. Copy saves to Provenance saves folder (via Finder)

### Can I switch from sideloaded Provenance to App Store version?

**Yes!** Your data transfers automatically:

1. Install **Provenance from App Store**
2. Launch app - library appears automatically (same data container)
3. (Optional) Delete sideloaded version

**iCloud note:** If using Provenance Plus, only enable sync on ONE version to avoid conflicts.

### Can I use both App Store and sideloaded versions?

**Yes, but not recommended** - can cause iCloud sync conflicts.

**If you must:**
- Use different bundle IDs when building from source
- Only enable iCloud sync on ONE version
- Data won't automatically transfer between versions

## Provenance Plus

### Why is CloudKit sync free on Apple TV but paid on iOS?

**Great question!** It's about the platform constraints:

**Apple TV has no permanent storage** - when you delete Provenance, your games and saves are gone. We include FREE CloudKit sync on tvOS so you never lose progress. It's not a premium feature, it's a necessity.

**iPhone/iPad have permanent storage** - your games and saves persist even if you delete the app. CloudKit sync is a premium convenience feature that lets you access your library on multiple devices.

**The upsell:**  
Love the seamless experience on Apple TV? Unlock that same magic on your iPhone and iPad with Provenance Plus. Start on your couch, continue on your commute. That's the premium experience we're selling.

**Bottom line:** tvOS sync = survival feature (free). iOS sync = premium multi-device experience (Plus).

### Is Provenance Plus worth it?

**Worth it if you:**
- ✅ **Own an Apple TV + iPhone/iPad** (seamless gaming across devices)
- ✅ Want to start games on your couch, continue on your commute
- ✅ Never want to lose save progress (automatic cloud backup)
- ✅ Have multiple Apple devices (library syncs to all of them)
- ✅ Want early access to new features

**Not worth it if you:**
- ❌ Only use Apple TV (sync is already free!)
- ❌ Only use one iOS device (manual backups work fine)
- ❌ Don't care about multi-device gaming

**The killer feature:** Start Final Fantasy VII on your TV, pick it up on your iPhone during lunch break, continue on your iPad in bed. All without manually transferring saves.

**Try it free:** We offer an App Store trial so you can experience seamless multi-device gaming before subscribing.

### How do I cancel Provenance Plus?

**iOS/iPadOS:**
1. Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions
2. Tap **Provenance Plus**
3. **Cancel Subscription**

**Mac:**
1. App Store → [Your Name] (top left) → Settings
2. Manage Subscriptions → Provenance Plus
3. Cancel

**Your subscription remains active until the end of the billing period.**

### Does Provenance Plus work when sideloading?

**Yes!** But you need to use a **unique bundle ID** when building from Xcode.

**How:**
1. In Xcode, change bundle ID to something unique (e.g., `com.yourname.provenance`)
2. Build and install
3. Subscribe to Provenance Plus in-app
4. ✅ Plus features will work

**Default bundle ID:** Won't work - app thinks it's App Store version but can't verify subscription.
